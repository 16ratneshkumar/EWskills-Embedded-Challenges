# EWskills-Embedded-Challenges
This repository contains my personal solutions and notes for problems from the EWskills  platform, which focuses on Embedded Systems and Firmware Development. It includes hands-on exercises in C programming, bit manipulation, memory management, and register-level programmingâ€”designed to build real-world embedded coding skills.
