## ✅ Solution & Learning  

**Correct Option:**  
👉 **2) B (Shunt Resistor)**  

---

### 📘 Learning  

A **shunt resistor** is a **low-resistance, high-precision** component used for **current measurement** by monitoring the **voltage drop** across it (Ohm’s Law: *V = I × R*).  

**Key Features of Shunt Resistors:**  
- Very **low resistance values** (e.g., `0.01Ω`, `0.1Ω`)  
- Often marked with **“R” notation** (e.g., `0R01`, `0.01`)  
- Typically come in **SMD packages** with wide terminals for:  
  - Heat dissipation  
  - Accurate voltage sensing

### ⚡ Why This Is Important  

➡️ Shunt resistors are widely used in:  
- **Battery monitoring systems**  
- **Power supplies**  
- **Motor control circuits**  

They allow **safe & accurate current measurement** without disturbing the main circuit flow.  

➡️ **Recognizing them visually** is essential in **reverse engineering, debugging, and repair** scenarios.
