## ✅ Solution & Learning  

**Correct Option:**  
👉 **1) 10kΩ**

### 📘 Learning  

**SMD resistors** use **three-digit codes** to represent values:  

- **1st digit** → First significant figure  
- **2nd digit** → Second significant figure  
- **3rd digit** → Multiplier (power of 10)  

For code **“103”**:  
- 1st digit = **1**  
- 2nd digit = **0**  
- 3rd digit = **3 → add three zeros**  

### 📌 Calculation:
$$
10 \times 1,000 = 10,000Ω = 10kΩ
$$

### ⚡ Why This Is Important  

- SMD resistors **don’t have color bands**.  
- Numeric code reading is **essential** in:  
  - Modern PCBs  
  - Compact layouts  
  - SMT assemblies  
- Accurate decoding prevents:  
  - Wrong part placement  
  - Debugging delays  
  - Costly rework in production
