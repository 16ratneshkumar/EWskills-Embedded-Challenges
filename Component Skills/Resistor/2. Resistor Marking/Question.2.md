### 📘 Learning  

This **MELF resistor** uses a **standard 4-band color code**:  

- **1st Band (Red)** = 2  
- **2nd Band (Red)** = 2  
- **3rd Band (Black)** = ×1  
- **4th Band (Brown)** = ±1% tolerance  

### 📌 Calculation:
$$
22 \times 1 = 22Ω \; (±1\%)
$$

### ⚡ Why This Is Important  

- Unlike many SMD components, **MELF resistors don’t use numeric codes**.  
- You must **visually read the color bands**.  
- This skill is critical for:  
  - Manual inspection  
  - Reverse engineering  
  - Component-level debugging on <abbr title="Surface Mount">SMT</abbr> boards
