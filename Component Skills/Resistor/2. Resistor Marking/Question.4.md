### 📘 Learning  

A **standard 4-band resistor** follows this format:  
```
[1st Digit] [2nd Digit] × Multiplier ± Tolerance
```
For the given color bands:  
- **Brown** = 1  
- **Black** = 0  
- **Orange** = ×1,000  
- **Gold** = ±5%  

### 📌 Calculation: 
$$
10 \times 1,000 = 10,000Ω = 10kΩ \; (±5\%)
$$

### ⚡ Why This Is Important  

- Reading resistor color codes is a **fundamental electronics skill**.  
- Frequently  encounter **unlabeled resistors** in:  
  - PCBs  
  - Prototyping boards  
  - Debugging & repair work  
- Knowing manual decoding:  
  - Saves time  
  - Helps select replacements without a multimeter  
  - Useful for **BOM verification** & component sourcing
