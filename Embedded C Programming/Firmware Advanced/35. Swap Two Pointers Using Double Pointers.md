# 🧩 Problem 35: Swap Two Pointers Using Double Pointers

### 📝 Problem Statement

Write a **C program** to **swap two pointers** using **double pointers**.

The program should:

* Take two integers as input:

  * `a` and `b`
* Create two pointers:

  * `p1` points to `a`
  * `p2` points to `b`
* Use a function with parameters as double pointers (`int **p1, int **p2`) to swap the pointers themselves (not the values they point to)
* After swapping, print the values pointed to by `p1` and `p2`

### ✅ Examples

#### Example 1

```
Input:
a = 10, b = 20

Output:
a points to 20, b points to 10
```

#### Example 2

```
Input:
a = 5, b = 15

Output:
a points to 15, b points to 5
```

### 💻 Solution

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void swap_pointers(int **p1, int **p2) {
    int *temp = *p1;
    *p1 = *p2;
    *p2 = temp;
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    int *p1 = &a;
    int *p2 = &b;

    swap_pointers(&p1, &p2);

    printf("%d %d", *p1, *p2);

    return 0;
}
```
