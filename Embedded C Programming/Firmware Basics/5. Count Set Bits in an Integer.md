# 🧩 Problem 5: Count Set Bits in an Integer

### 📝 Problem Statement

Write a **C program** to **count the number of set bits (1s)** in the binary representation of a given integer `N`.

The program should:

* Take an integer `N` as input  
* Count how many bits are set to `1` in its binary form  
* Print the count

### ✅ Examples

#### Example 1

```
Input: 5 
Expected Output: 2
```

**Explanation**
```
5   = 101 (binary) 
Count = 2
```
---

#### Example 2

```
Input: 0 
Expected Output: 0
```

**Explanation**

```
0   = 0000 (binary) 
Count = 0
```
---

#### Example 3

```
Input: 15 
Expected Output: 4
```

**Explanation**

```
15  = 1111 (binary) 
Count = 4
```
---

#### Example 4

```
Input: 1023 
Expected Output: 10
```

**Explanation**

```
1023 = 1111111111 (binary) 
Count = 10
```

---

### 💡 Hint

Use **bitwise AND (`&`)** with `1` to check the last bit, and then right shift (`>>`) repeatedly until the number becomes `0`.

---

### 💻 Solution (C)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int countSetBits(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        count += (n & 1); 
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("%d", countSetBits(n));
    return 0;
}
```
