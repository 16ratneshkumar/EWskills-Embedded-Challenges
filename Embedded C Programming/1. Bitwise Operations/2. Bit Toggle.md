# 🧩 Problem 2: Bit Toggle

### 📝 Problem Statement

Write a **C program** to **toggle the 5th bit** (using 0-based indexing) of a given integer.

The program should:

* Take an integer `N` as input
* **Toggle the 5th bit** of `N`:

  * If the bit is `0`, change it to `1`
  * If the bit is `1`, change it to `0`

> 📌 **Note**: The 5th bit means **bit at index 5** (from the right), i.e., `1 << 5`.

### ✅ Examples

#### Example 1

```
Input: 10
Expected Output: 42
```

**Explanation**

```
10        = 00001010 (binary)
Toggle 5th bit → 00101010
Result         = 42 (decimal)
```

---

#### Example 2

```
Input: 31
Expected Output: 95
```

**Explanation**

```
31        = 00011111 (binary)
Toggle 5th bit → 01011111
Result         = 95 (decimal)
```

---

#### Example 3

```
Input: 0
Expected Output: 32
```

**Explanation**

```
0         = 00000000 (binary)
Toggle 5th bit → 00100000
Result         = 32 (decimal)
```

### 💡 Hint

Use the **XOR (`^`) operator** with a mask to toggle a specific bit.

### 💻 Solution (C)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int toggleFifthBit(int n) {
    return n ^ (1<<5);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("%d", toggleFifthBit(n));
    return 0;
}
```
