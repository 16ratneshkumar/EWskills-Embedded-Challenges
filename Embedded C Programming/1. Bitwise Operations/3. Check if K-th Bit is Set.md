# 🧩 Problem 3: Check if K-th Bit is Set

### 📝 Problem Statement

Write a **C program** to **check if the K-th bit (0-based index)** of an integer `N` is **set** (`1`) or **not set** (`0`) in its binary representation.

The program should:

* Take two integers `N` and `K` as input
* Check whether the **K-th bit** (starting from the right, 0-based index) is set to 1 or not.

Output Format

* Print `1` if the bit is set(1), else print `0`

### ✅ Examples

#### Example 1

```
Input: 
N = 8 
K = 3

Expected Output: 
1
```

**Explanation**

```
Binary of 8  = 00001000
Bit at index 3 = 1 → Set → Output: 1
```

---

### 💡 Hint

Use a **bitwise AND** operation between `N` and `1 << K`.
If the result is non-zero, then the bit is set.

### 💻 Solution (C)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int isKthBitSet(int n, int k) {
    return n & (1 << k) ? 1:0;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
    printf("%d", isKthBitSet(n, k));
    return 0;
}
```
